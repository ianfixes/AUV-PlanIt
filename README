AUV tools by Ian Katz (ijk5@mit.edu)

A web interface designed to sit on the topside and do the following:
 1. show locations of vehicle and chase boat
 2. plan missions (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK0wWH9Ijnk)

This code is currently lacking excessive comments, and the KML generation needs to be
revamped.  You will need to write your own mission-exporting code.

Built and tested on Ubuntu Linux; all documentation will assume that OS.

In order to install AUV-PlanIt: 
 0. you will need to install my (small) PHP library: https://github.com/ifreecarve/AUV-phplib
 1. set your web root (the htdocs directory) in the sites-available file
 2. remove the default symlink in /etc/apache/sites-enabled and put the AUV PlanIT one there.  shell commands:
        cp _etc_apache2_sites-available_auv-planit /etc/apache2/sites-available/auv-planit
        cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
        rm 000-default
        ln -s ../sites-available/auv-planit ./000-auv-planit
 3. create a MySQL database called ap using the schema_planit.sql file.  shell commands:
        echo "create database ap;" | mysql -u YOUR_USERNAME -pYOUR_PASSWORD
        mysql  -u YOUR_USERNAME -pYOUR_PASSWORD ap < schema_planit.sql
 4. populate the ap database using the somedata.sql file.  shell commands:
        mysql  -u YOUR_USERNAME -pYOUR_PASSWORD ap < somedata.sql
 5. copy htdocs/_CONFIG-example.php to htdocs/_CONFIG.php and modify it to give the location and credentials of your mysql db (and other settings)
